With the <a href="http://www.idxmatrix.com">IDXMATRIX</a> plugin, bloggers can embed live real estate listings (With Internet Data Exchange, or IDX) into their blog’s posts and pages using something Word Press calls “short codes” and into their sidebars using the included widgets. The plugin also functions as a full IDX solution by allowing visitors to search for, and view the details of, listings in the MLS.

<a href="http://www.idxmatrix.com">IDXMATRIX</a> plugin contains many advanced features that enable bloggers to create “sticky content,” visitors to find properties they like, and search engines to crawl the MLS data so that the listings show up with the blogger’s domain in the search engines. It is intended to be a real estate agent’s / brokers all-inclusive interface between the MLS they belong to and their Word Press site/blog. Following is a very high-level overview of the plugin’s functionality.

•	It actually embeds the live MLS data INTO the blog — it does NOT use HTML “I frames!”

•	It is extremely easy to set up, Download it and click on activate there’s only one field to fill in (the activation key) to activate all of the plugin’s functionality.

•	<a href="http://www.idxmatrix.com">IDXMATRIX</a> plugin is exceptionally fast. In some cases, loading the MLS data is actually faster than loading the Word Press data!

•	A large number of similar details too numerous to mention are built into the core of the plugin.

•	It has built-in support for Word Press short codes, allowing bloggers to embed live listing data from the MLS into their blog posts/pages. Adding, adjusting these short codes is made easy by using the tools that <a href="http://www.idxmatrix.com">IDXMATRIX</a> builds into Word Press’s page.

•    The <a href="http://www.idxmatrix.com">IDXMATRIX</a> plugin short code embeds listings for particular areas into a blog post/page. For example, if a blogger typed [IDX-listings city="Maryland" count="10"] into their post, the 10 newest listings from the MLS in Maryland would show up in place of that text when the post is displayed each listing/photo links to the full property details. The data is live, so whether the post is viewed the next day or the next month, the 10 newest listings would always be displayed.

•	The IDX Listings widget allows to show listings within an area (city, community, tract, or zip), show their own listings, show their office’s listings, or show listings based on a completely customizable search. The widget can be configured to show up to 20 listings at a time and can be set to show the properties in a list view, grid view and map view, the following shows in a detailed slideshow.

•	The IDX Areas widget allows displaying a simple list of links to the different areas (cities, communities, tracts, or zips) they service. This makes it super easy for website visitors and search engines to view all of the listings in that area.

•	The plugin has a great deal of intelligent URL handling functionality built-in. It supports and actively enforces canonical URLs and 301 redirects where appropriate to the functionality of the IDX. The URL structure itself is designed to be clean, simple, and readable.
